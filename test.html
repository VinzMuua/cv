        <li> LPong was the first game developed by Atari.[6][7] After producing Computer Space, Bushnell decided to form
            a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The first contract was with Bally
            Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game.[5][8] Soon after the founding, Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn
            because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had
            previously worked with him at Ampex. Prior to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video
            games.[9] Bushnell had originally planned to develop a driving video game, influenced by Chicago Coin's
            Speedway (1969) which at the time was the biggest-selling electro-mechanical game at his amusement
            arcade.[10] However, Bushnell had concerns that it might be too complicated for Alcorn's first game.[11]

            To acclimate Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly meant to be a warm-up
            exercise.[9][12] Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked
            Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping.[9] In 2011,
            Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before;
            Bushnell played a version on a PDP-1 computer in 1964 while attending college.[13] However, Alcorn has
            claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell's viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey's Tennis game.[9] In May
            1972, Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame, California where he played the
            Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game.[14][15] Though he thought the game
            lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn.[13]egalized gambling, playing
